<img src="images/kcs_2.0.png" width="1000" >

## Background
Since the release of the orginal [KCH problem](https://github.com/xweih/kcs), the menus of the restaurant has changed to some degree. Consequently, it affected the utility of my previous model. So in this post, I outline the menu change, and the subsequent model updates. 


## Menu Change

Other than the price increase, the old menus, including Build Your Own Seafood Bag and Seafood Combos, remain the same. However, new order options have been added as follows. 

1. The option to order crabs (snow crab, king crab, and dungenese crab) by the half-pound. Previously, one can only order these items by the whole-pound.

| Build your own bag  | Price $/lb | 
| :------  | ---: | 

| king crab (1/2 lb)   |	30.99|
| snow crab (1/2 lb)    |	19.99|
| dungeness crab (1/2 lb)|19.99|

2. Additional single items: egg and broccoli

3. For the ordering option "Build Your Own Seafood Bag", each bag will receive up to 1 corn and 1 potato for free, if any seafood item is ordered.
